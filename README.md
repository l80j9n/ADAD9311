Assessment Description and feedback process:
The practice of   exhibition design is a highly engaging and often   ephemeral   experiential   format,   that   has   evolved   to   become   an   integral   part   of   our   sociocultural   activity.
Contemporary exhibition design builds on thousands of years of   human   experience   in   creative   storytelling through art, the display of meaningful objects, and the   shaping   of spaces   for   contemplation,   focused attention, and heightened experience.   Every decision   in an   exhibition   design   is   informed   by   this history – whether we are aware of it or   not. The   changing   paradigms   and   models   of display   embody,   perform, and reinforce different ways of knowing and   understanding   the world,   as well   as   how   knowledge is conceived. They also represent the   semantics   of these   epistemologies—how their   creators choose to represent and communicate knowledge   and   power.
Informed by display paradigms discussed   in class, this   assessment   task   asks   you   to   ideate   the   concept   and curate the content for a small exhibition to   be   held   in   a   Sydney-based   cultural   institution. With   consideration to the structure, sequencing, and display of works, you will devise and   design   a   range   of   texts that support your exhibition   ideas.
Feedback will be provided on a   regular basis   through   discussion   with   peers   and   your   tutor.   Summative   assessment and feedback on this assessment task will be   provided digitally.
How to complete this assessment:
Exhibitions are a highly structured visual communication   medium.   Central to   every   exhibition   is   an   interpretation plan and approach for how the content and complexity   of   information   is   to   be   communicated.      For this   assessment you will develop a curatorial concept for a Sydney-based   institution,   exploring   its   identity   and   relevant precedents as well as analysing and proposing   display   strategies   fitting   for   your   exhibition.
For this assessment you will develop a curatorial concept as well   as   explore   and   analyse   display   strategies,   precedents, and institutional identities.   In response to   the   historic   and   contemporary   display   paradigms   presented   in class you will also apply insights and   provide context   to   those   employed   or   referenced   (invoked   or   subverted) within your exhibition.
Your project report will showcase a range   of descriptive   and   interpretive texts   that   communicate   the   scope   and   stories of your exhibition to a range of audiences, incorporating   both   practical   and   thematic   information.
Steps to follow:
1. Select a Venue: Choose one of the following venues for your exhibition:
•            The   Australia   Museum                                                                                      •             Elizabeth   Bay   House or Vaucluse   House
•            The   Powerhouse   Museum                                                                           •             Firstdraft
•            White   Rabbit Gallery                                                                                           •            Australian   Design Centre
2. Curate   Content
Research and select 8-12 artworks, objects, or design   projects for   inclusion   in   an   exhibition to   be featured   at   the   selected venue. The ideas communicated in the exhibition   and   the format   underpinning   it   should   be   your   original   concept.

3. Consider the   Experience
Design the format, structure and sequence   of your exhibition and identify   key   display   paradigms   to   employ   or   reference in the exhibition   space.
4. Craft the Communication   Methods
Produce the following texts that communicate your exhibition scope and stories:
•             Exhibition Concept   Precis – including curatorial rationale,   analysis   of   institutional   identity,   approach   to   display and narrative   strategy
•             Object list (for curators/conservators/designers etc)
•             Exhibition text example (found   in the   exhibition)
Choose from an introductory panel; theme   panel;   or,   extended   object   label for   an   object/artwork
•             Short/standard object labels for all   objects/artworks]
•            Audience   feedback   document
•             Formal essay (1000 words – academic writing with references)   responding to the   question:
Which   display   paradigms   were   employed   in   the   design/curation   of   your   proposed   exhibition?
With reference to your chosen venue’s identity   and the   historic   and   contemporary   display   paradigms   addressed in class, consider how and why your exhibition   employs,   invokes   or   subverts   these   exhibition-   making conventions and techniques.
With the exhibition texts, ensure you have   considered:
•             Institutional context
•             Graphic design (font, size, colour,   materiality)
•             Physical context (location and   installation   method)
•          Audience context   (adjustments   specific   to   target   audiences   incl.   content,   readability,   accessibility)
It is important to consider both the   hierarchy   and   clarity   of   information   conveyed within   the   texts   as well   as   the   layout of the texts themselves.   Decisions on graphic design elements such as font   selection, text   size   and   formatting and the relationship between text and visuals   are   critical to   clear   communication   of your exhibition   ideas and the significant objects and stories contained within   it.   Interactive   prompts or technology-based   communication methods can be represented. You   may wish to   include   mockups   for   QR   codes,   or   show   how   an   online audience survey would appear to the user, or an   idea for   audience   information that   uses   mobile   devices.   Note: a visual representation of the format is sufficient; you   do   not   need   to   do   the   programming.
Course Learning Outcomes being assessed in this task:
1. Apply research methods to inform. a   response   to   the   requirements   of a   design   brief
2.   Examine and critically analyse the relationship between   key   stakeholders
3.   Demonstrate design practice as an interdisciplinary and   collaborative   process
